Species-XML
===========

This a project for Data Structures and Algorithms at UF written in C++ that takes species.xml file as input, and can then get the lineage of a species, or the common lineage of two species. The program takes the input of species.xml, and parses it into a tree structure. It can be run from the command line, or from the built in menus. Not that the filepath is hardcoded for testing in xcode, and will need to be changed to be run.

The original project can be found here: http://www.cise.ufl.edu/class/cop3530sp13/projects/project3.html
